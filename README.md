## What ?

Yet another gallery (generator) in order to share the stuffs I made with my camera.

This work is heavily inspired by [the one](https://github.com/SpaceFox/coree.spacefox.fr) of [Spacefox](https://coree.spacefox.fr/pages/spacefox/) (distributed under [MIT](https://github.com/SpaceFox/coree.spacefox.fr/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
Some (technical) ideas originated from [Sigal](http://sigal.saimon.org/en/latest/index.html).

## How ?

Written in [python](https://python.org/) and based on

+ [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) to handle the images ;
+ [Colorthief](https://pypi.org/project/colorthief/) to extract color palette (though it is not perfect) ;
+ [Python Markdown](https://pypi.org/project/Markdown/) for adding information ;
+ [Jinja2](https://pypi.org/project/Jinja2/) for the templating engine ;
+ [lightgallery.js](https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightgallery.js) for the lightbox JS stuff.
