## What ?

Yet another gallery (generator) in order to share the stuffs I made with my camera.

This work is heavily inspired by [the one](https://coree.spacefox.fr/) of [Spacefox](https://coree.spacefox.fr/pages/spacefox/), distributed under [CC BY 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
Some idea were also taken from [Sigal](http://sigal.saimon.org/en/latest/index.html).

## How ?

Written in [python](https://python.org/) and based on

+ [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) to handle the images ;
+ [Colorthief](https://pypi.org/project/colorthief/) to extract color palette (though it is not perfect) ;
+ [Python Markdown](https://pypi.org/project/Markdown/) for adding information ;
+ [Jinja2](https://pypi.org/project/Jinja2/) for the templating engine ;
+ [lightgallery.js](https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightgallery.js) for the lightbox JS stuff.
